1. Count the number of records in the table:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]


2. Display the first 10 records in the table:

SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]


3. Find the distinct room categories available:

SELECT DISTINCT room_category
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]


4. Calculate the total number of successful bookings:

SELECT SUM(successful_bookings) AS total_successful_bookings
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]


5. Find the total capacity of all properties:

SELECT SUM(capacity) AS total_capacity
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]


6. List properties with the highest and lowest capacity:

SELECT TOP 1 property_id, capacity
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]

ORDER BY capacity DESC; -- Highest capacity

SELECT TOP 1 property_id, capacity
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]
ORDER BY capacity ASC; -- Lowest capacity

7. Calculate the average capacity per room category:

SELECT room_category, AVG(capacity) AS average_capacity
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]
GROUP BY room_category;

9. Find the date with the highest number of successful bookings:

SELECT check_in_date, MAX(successful_bookings) AS max_successful_bookings
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings];


10. Find the date with the lowest number of successful bookings:

SELECT check_in_date, MIN(successful_bookings) AS min_successful_bookings
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]


11. Calculate the success rate for each room category:

SELECT room_category, 
       SUM(successful_bookings) * 100.0 / SUM(capacity) AS success_rate_percentage
FROM [Hospitality Database].[dbo].[fact_aggregated_bookings]
GROUP BY room_category;
